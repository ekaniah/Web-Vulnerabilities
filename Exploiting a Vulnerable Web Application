# Lab Title: Web Vulnerabilities

## Date: 06/06/2024

## Lab Overview:
Web Vulnerabilities
This lab gives one a hands-on experience with web vulnerabilities by exploiting a vulnerable web application.
Specifically, you’ll use Armitage and Metasploit to take advantage of a common vulnerability known as the XAMPP WebDAV PHP upload vulnerability.
Then, you’ll walk though the process of assessing the impact of web application vulnerabilities in order to implement solutions to mitigate these attacks.

### Part 1 - Exploiting a Vulnerable web application

#### Time for Lab Completion:

 1hr

#### Purpose of the Lab:
To teach one how to exploit a vulnerable web application.
Use an external Kali attack machine on the wide area network, or WAN, to attack a web application on the network. 
Use Armitage, which is a front end for Metasploit, to exploit a machine using XAMPP WebDAV PHP Upload exploit.

#### What did you enjoy about the lab?

Nothing really.

#### What did you find most challenging about the lab?
I failed to compromise the server twice and couldn't figure out why. It worked on my 3 try.
